# Toshik Rathore — Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website built using **Next.js (App Router)**, designed to be fast, scalable, and modern. It highlights my work, skills, and journey as a developer, while maintaining high performance, responsiveness, and clean code architecture.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

Built entirely with **Next.js**, styled using **Tailwind CSS**, animated with **Framer Motion**, and deployed on **Vercel**. It uses modern development practices including utility-first CSS, declarative animations, and optimized font loading with `@next/font`. All tools and services used are free and production-ready.

## 📁 Pages & Structure

The project includes the following primary pages:
- **Home** – A quick intro with CTA
- **About** – My journey, stack, and resume
- **Projects** – Featured projects with tech tags and links
- **Contact** – Social links and (form support coming soon)

Additional features include dark mode support and horizontal infinite scrolling in certain UI sections.

## 🛠 Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run dev server

Visit http://localhost:3000 to view it locally. The site supports hot reload via Next.js.

🔧 Tooling & Dev Experience
Code quality is maintained using Prettier, ESLint, and Husky for pre-commit hooks. The codebase is modular, component-driven, and uses modern linting and formatting standards. Folder structure is intuitive and clean for long-term maintainability.

🌍 Deployment
This site is deployed on Vercel, taking advantage of Next.js-native optimizations including SSR, static generation, and image optimization.
